# Holt lab meeting 'show and tell' code examples 
## (AKA cool R packages I found on the internet)   
  
This repo contains a series of example code for Holt lab meeting 'show and tell' presentations (where we all share a super cool tool and/or paper we found with the team).  I decided to share the Rmd files for these examples after a few of my team mates asked me if they could take a look at the code to see if they could use it on their datasets.  

Please find in here example code for:   

##Data visualisation:  

1. [Scatterpie R package](https://github.com/GuangchuangYu/scatterpie) - Fab R package that allows you to overlay pie charts onto a map & colour the countries by a variable.  Super useful for showing global distributions of genotype and AMR frequencies of bacterial pathogens.  


##Phylodynamic analyses:  

1. [Skygrowth R package](https://github.com/mrc-ide/skygrowth)     
2. [Transphylo R package](https://xavierdidelot.github.io/TransPhylo/index.html). 
3. [BactDating R package](https://github.com/xavierdidelot/BactDating). 


##AMR phenotype analysis:  
1. [AMR R package](https://msberends.github.io/AMR/).
